What are we storing?
	links to secure and unsecure content at different providers per employer
	analytic data from the front-end
	gamification data that ties to analytic data
	
What are we not storing?
	obviously no pii, no phi
	
Is it temporal? (are we really just talking about session?)
	No, it will be reported on in different systems

Who wants this data?
	SalesForce
	analytic engine (back-end log tool from piwik)

Can it be represented in a traditional relational database?
	Yes, but why?

transaction's aren't important
relationships aren't important , it takes analysis and non-linear thinking to find causation/correlation 
all of that is just overhead
external events (webhook data) is dynamic
allows us to loosely couple external vendor event data
real-time analytics (vendor and benefit market) + sales force event processing + gamification = a bunch of unstructured event data 
raven is not free
mongo has more support
could be deployed along side the application, similar to how app+database exist on one server for umbraco
built-in support for ravendb (management studio + paid support)
